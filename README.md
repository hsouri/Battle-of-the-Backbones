# Battle of the Backbones: A Large-Scale Comparison of Pretrained Models across Computer Vision Tasks

This repository is the official implementation of the [*Battle of the Backbones: A Large-Scale Comparison of Pretrained Models across Computer Vision Tasks*](https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.19909).


<strong>Battle of the Backbones (BoB)</strong> compares many popular publicly available pretrained checkpoints, as well as randomly initialized baselines, on a wide variety of downstream tasks including <strong>image classification</strong> on natural, medical, and satellite images, <strong>object detection and segmentation</strong>, <strong>out-of-distribution generalization</strong>, and <strong>image retrieval</strong>.

## Usage

For each vision task, please refer to its respective repository for detailed documentation, source code, and further information:
